# Hello-world
Nothing cool in here, guys, just figuring out how to use github

Also, my name's Matthew Czech and as of right now I'm relatively new to programming, I do know Java pretty well but that's about it-for now.
I am in the process of learning C++ and Python, and I'm going to participate in a hackathon in a couple of days and learn a lot from that.
